# AbarcaJAllForOneRepository
Completed 1/7/22
This is my first full stack developed app! It includes a multiplicity of mini challeneges that I did during my time in the academy as an assignment! I created an API and cleared the CORs policy error and then used that API to work with our Front End being all of our mini challenges. In addition to that, I added data validation to limit the user's ability to break the application. We used Microsoft Azure to create to create webapps for both the api and the front-end to be utilized so they can communicate with one another, and we used FileZilla to upload our site's files to our webapp that is hosted on Azure.
